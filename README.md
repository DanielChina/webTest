# webTest
A Selenium-based testing code with a clear structure. 
This test code takes www.trademe.co.nz as an example to have a test, which includes login test, boundary test and navigation test.
Testing case data can be fetched from Excel file and the results will be written to the Excel file. 
So it is really convenient for those who want to have a testing report.
